# Calculate

This is a simple application built using flutter framework.

## Completed
1. Added a basic calculator layout for the app.

## TODO
1. Implement backend of the app using the logic from the calc2.py file from the simple-interpreter repo. The app will be able to evaluate expressions containing parentheses, addition, subtraction, multiplicaton and division. This stage will only have suport for multi-digit integer numbers. Support for floating point numbers will be included in a later stage.
2. Extend functionality to evaluate expressions containing floating point numbers and functions like sin, cos, log, etc.
